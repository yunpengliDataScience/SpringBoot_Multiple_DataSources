Use "skip-certificate-check" Jenkins plugin to walk around PKIX valid cert error:

Since the PKIX valid cert error prevents Jenkins from downloading Jenkins plugins through its GUI interface, it is also impossible to download "skip-certificate-check" plugin through the GUI either.
To break such dead-lock, the "skip-certificate-check" plugin needs to be downloaded and installed manually:
1. Visit https://plugins.jenkins.io/skip-certificate-check/releases/ to download skip-certificate-check.hpi through a direct download link.
2. Save skip-certificate-check.hpi into the jenkins plugins directory (e.g. C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\plugins).
3. Change the extenstion .hpi to be .jpi (skip-certificate-check.jpi).
4. Restart Jenkins service.

Then Jenkins should be able to dowload plugins without PKIX valid cert errors.
